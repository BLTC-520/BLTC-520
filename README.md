# Hi there! 👋

A recent CompSci Grad, passionate about Web3 technologies, smart contracts, and bridging blockchain with modern frontend frameworks. Currently, I’m diving deep into **GMXv2** and exploring the mechanics of **perpetual DEXs** — swaps, limit orders, and everything in between. 🚀 

# "Currently Working" Section (update weekly)

- Fifth week of **Season 8 - School of Solana** hosted by Ackee Blockchain Security, ready to dive in some security-related topics!
- Vibe Code a travelling website for my December Trip in Danang using Gemini 3! 

# 🛠️ Recent Work

Built a Solana Devnet webapp where users can publish, edit, and delete on-chain notes, while others can upvote or tip authors with SOL. It’s a lightweight social layer that lives fully on-chain.
